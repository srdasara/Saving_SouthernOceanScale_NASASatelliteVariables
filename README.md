# Saving Southern Ocean-scale variables from NASA CALIPSO, MODIS, and passive microwave remote sensing sensors  
This repository is dedicated towards showing my methods for extracting and calculating marine aerosol optical depth (MAOD), depolarization ratio or sea ice, chlorophyll-_a_ concentration, and wind speed. Check out the videos below, which provided a rough sanity check that I'm doing this correctly! As an aside, these are Not publication-worthy figures, but allowed me to feel confident in conducting future analyses since the data grab worked correctly.
